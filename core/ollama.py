"""
This script contains utilities for interacting with a language model server to perform operations
on processor-related hardware description language (HDL) files. It provides functions for sending
prompts, parsing responses, and generating outputs relevant to processor verification and design.

Features:
- **Server Communication**: Interact with the specified language model server to process prompts.
- **File Filtering**: Identify and filter files relevant to processor functionality.
- **Top Module Detection**: Extract the processor's top module for further use in synthesis or
    simulation.
- **Verilog File Generation**: Automatically generate Verilog files to connect the processor with
  verification infrastructures.

Modules:
- **`send_prompt`**: Sends a prompt to the language model and returns the response.
- **`parse_filtered_files`**: Parses text to extract a list of filtered HDL files.
- **`remove_top_module`**: Extracts the name of the top module from the model's response.
- **`get_filtered_files_list`**: Filters processor-relevant files using model analysis.
- **`get_top_module`**: Identifies the processor's top module based on file data and dependencies.
- **`generate_top_file`**: Creates a Verilog file for processor and verification infrastructure
    integration.

Dependencies:
- `ollama`: A client library for interacting with the language model.
- Standard Python libraries: `os`, `re`, and `time`.

Configuration:
- `SERVER_URL`: Specifies the server's URL for the language model.

Usage:
1. Adjust the `SERVER_URL` to point to the correct language model server.
2. Use the provided functions to filter files, identify the top module, and generate necessary
    Verilog files.
3. Outputs can be used in HDL simulations, synthesis, and verification.

Note:
- Ensure the server is running and accessible.
- All file paths and directory structures must match the expected inputs for successful operations.
